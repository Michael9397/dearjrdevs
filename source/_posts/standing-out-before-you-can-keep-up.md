In an earlier career, I was an electrician.  Of course before I was an electrician, 
I was an electrician’s helper.  While I was mechanically inclined, I didn’t know 
enough about electrical work in order to be helpful doing it.   What really 
surprised me was that I still had many ways that I could be helpful and stand out.  
My first day working, they needed people to dig a trench so they can run some 
unground wire.  It turns out I didn’t need any special knowledge to dig, as someone 
who grew up on a farm, I had that down.  There were three of us out there digging, 
and half way through the morning, the supervisor showed up.  My ditch was almost 
twice as far as either of the other guys.

I don’t know if I learned the lesson that day, but it strongly reinforced to me 
that hard work and willingness to try goes a long ways.  The funny thing is, the 
next thing I did was stop working for 15 minutes.  The supervisor saw my progress 
and came up to talk to me and I happily engaged.  He had done my initial paperwork 
with me, but this was the first time he seemed interested in me.  We talked about 
my background and how I hoped to grow at the company.  The conversation did more 
for me that morning than the digging.  I started to build a relationship and trust. 
He walked away from that conversation thinking I was someone worth investing in.

Normally, new developers I see also come in working hard and usually to a fault.  
They beat themselves up over running into errors setting up their machines.  Maybe 
they struggle with the linux commands or have a problem with their operating system.  
They won’t take the necessary break to start thinking clearly again and so they beat 
their heads against simple problems.  Often in an effort to impress their new bosses 
or coworkers, they turn down conversations because they want so badly to show 
progress.  This is a huge mistake.

Most of the problems you will face during your first few weeks have been seen and 
fixed by people around you multiple times.  They know a lot of the pitfalls you are 
about to run into because they have hit them as well.  Not only that, they have had 
conversations with other co-workers so they have workshopped the issue and more 
solid solutions often.   There is nothing impressive about the person that doesn’t 
take help or stop to have a decent conversation to show they can fix something after 
an hour when they were offered help.

The second reason it’s a mistake is because as a new developer you don’t have a lot 
to offer in code production, so to stand out, you need to build the relationships 
and build rapport.  One of the biggest things you can set up in your first month 
working for a company is people’s impression of you.  Do they see you as a team 
player?  Who ends up mentoring you or watching over you probably has a lot to do 
with the personality you present.

If I remember right, it was two days later when all of the digging was done that we 
were all split up to start working for individual foreman.  I was never told why I 
got teamed up with my new boss, but I ended up with a really good match. When I saw 
the other new guys in the office, they complained about how their bosses just 
complained to them all of the time.  The work ethic opened my door to the 
relationship building, and the relationship building put me on track to a successful 
path with that company.

Always take a bit of time and think about what your boss wants to hear from you.  
Before you submit your first pull request, there is a lot you can do to build up 
your rapport.  Asking someone about a specific part of the company culture is a 
great place to start.  Asking them questions about what has made previous new 
developers successful shows your interest in wanting to succeed.  A boss wants to 
know you care about their business.  Asking questions showing you are interested 
about more than your coding duties is a great conversation to have as well.

Ultimately this is a don’t lose sight of the forest because of one large 
intimidating tree.  Don’t over focus on getting a few tasks done that you miss out 
on building relationships.  Don’t miss out on working the relationship side of your 
job that is a major factor to your success.
