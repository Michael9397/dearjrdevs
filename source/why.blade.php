        When a new developer starts a job, there is so much going on for them.
        There is so much to learn and it's feels like they are struggling to keep up.
        What I want is to help them maintain perspective and make good choices to help
        them start out well.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        As an easy example, one of the biggest things I see is people put their heads down and
        try to work so hard on whatever problem they are coming across that they forget
        to take breaks and get perspective when they are stuck.  One of the first things
        a new coder learns is that when you are stuck, step back and take a break.  But
        when they start, they don't feel the freedom to clear their head.  They need to
        hear that clearing their head is still the smart choice.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        The idea of this site is to build up a collection of articles to help them focus and
        grow when they start out so they can start off strong and avoid some common pitfalls.
        I want the ethos of this to be letters from a friendly developer who is trying to
        help them succeed.  I want them to make decisions that make them productive members of
        their teams quicker for the Jr. dev's and the business's sake.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Picture me as an older developer who has watched the same struggles over and over from
        new developers have.  I see things they can't see yet because I've watched the starting
        out cycle quite a few times. I've seen people burn out and not make it, I've seen people
        thrive.  A small injection of perspective might be the difference between someone taking
        off well and someone who never gets off the ground.
