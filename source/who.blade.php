        Hi there! I'm a software developer who switched mid-career to web development
        around 2015. Long story short, I switched from a career in the construction
        industry when my wife asked me to quit so she could start a new career.  I
        didn't like staying at home, so I went back to school.  I got an associate's
        degree and started coding for a local company.  As I was working, I took night
        classes and got my master's degree in software development.  At the local
        community college, I also tutored computer programming students and taught
        a few computer science classes.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        I learned a lot about leading a team from when I was an electrician.  It
        seems a bit funny to me that it carries over so well.  Keeping a team
        positive and moving forward was the biggest factor for success.  Then when
        I got into teams of software developers, the team building process was largely
        ignored.  My first coding boss was a guy who was brilliant, but he had a
        decent language barrier.  I'm sure a couple stories of him will show up as
        his lack of personal skills probably helped drive me to make this.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        As I start this project, I've been a developer for a little over 7 years.  I'm not
        pretending to be the master coder who has all of the answers.  I'm someone who still
        remembers a lot of what it was like to start out.  I'm also someone who has tried to
        help many others who started out succeed.  I'm going through the process again right
        now, and as I watch two people start out (with one brand new to web development), I
        thought maybe the best thing to do would be to send them emails of reminders they need
        to hear.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Want to hear more about my perspective?  I've written quite a bit on Quora over the
        last few years.  I don't promise to still hold every position I've written, but it
        would let you see the kind of things I address and some general coding philosphy I've
        had.  <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Michael-Claar">Check out my Quora Profile</a>
        I don't try to answer every question, just the ones I think are genuine people trying
        to understand.

        Want to reach out to me?  Twitter seems the easiest way to reach me.  I mainly look
        at the Laravel community.  I don't post a lot of content at the moment.  See my profile
        <a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelDClaar">here</a>. I'm also on LinkedIn
        <a href="linkedin.com/in/michael-claar-8aba9487">here</a>.  I'll accept a friend request
        from anyone in development except recruiters normally.
