        <p>One of the clearest memories I have of when I started my first dev job was asking my boss for help.  When I had a question on the ticket’s he assigned me, he always asked questions like he didn’t know what I was talking about.  He made me explain to him what the ticket was for, what the issue was that I was having, and the steps I had tried before he would start analyzing my issue.  If I came back 5 minutes later, the process started all over.  He didn’t have memory issues, it was part of his process.</p>

<p>Often I felt like I was being treated like I was an idiot for it.  Why have me explain the same thing I had explained 5 minutes before.  The ticket hadn’t changed.  Was I really doing work so unimportant that it wasn’t worth remembering?  Often the problem hadn’t changed, only the list of solutions I tried had changed.  Maybe I had a new piece of feedback from the system, but I was stuck just the same.  It seemed he was more interested in repeating the ritual than getting to the interesting part.  It took me a couple weeks to figure it out, but my boss did me a real favor by running me through this process.</p>

<p>Not wanting to show him my frustration with having to go through the long explanation over and over, I decided to start messaging him instead of turning around and talking to him.  I thought I could at least copy/paste all of the set up part each time and maybe not have to repeat it.  I wrote out all of the answers for what he normally asked.  As I wrote it out, I started doubting some of my assumptions that I was making. I would prove to myself each step I took was true before I hit send to him.</p>

<p>Here’s what I made sure to include in what I wrote him:</p>

<ul>
<li>What the ticket was (usually with a hyper link)</li>
<li>What the problem I was having was.</li>
<li>What I had tried to fix it so far.</li>
<li>What my best guess to move forward was.</li>
</ul>

<p>What I found was that about half the time, I never sent the message to my boss.  By proving my assumptions to myself each step of the way, I often found errors in my thinking and the corrections lead me to a better solution.  As I got better, it got to about 80% of the time, I didn’t have to send the message to my boss.  I also found my boss’s attitude towards my issues improved.  He came over interested and already thinking about my problems when he walked up to my desk.   He was actively engaged and didn’t walk me through the basics anymore.</p>

<p>I can’t read what was in his mind and he’s no longer around to ask, but he taught me how and when to ask for help.  The answer isn’t after you’ve spent x amount of time trying or before you waste x number of company hours stuck.  You ask when you have researched your problem well enough to explain it thoroughly.  How you ask is by presenting your case for where you are stuck and how you have tried to fix it.  “Hey, I’ve got a problem” isn’t enticing to anyone.  “I’ve tried these things and here’s what I can’t get past” is intriguing.  It makes someone interested to see if they could see what you tried and couldn’t.  Having been on the other side of it now, it honestly makes it more fun.</p>

<p>It’s rare now, but if I’m really stuck, I will still write out a request for help on occasion.  I don’t have anyone to send it to anymore, but going through the process helps me align what I think I’m seeing with what is actually happening.  A lot of people recommend the rubber duck approach (explaining the problem out loud to an inanimate object).  I find writing it out works better for me.  I glaze over parts when no one is questioning me back, but if I write it out I tend to capture more information.  Maybe because it slows me down, maybe because I take it more seriously.  Give it a shot and see what works best for you.  We aren’t all built the same, so your mileage may vary.</p>
