        <p>When a Jr. Dev is first hired, they normally feel an immense pressure to produce.  It’s painfully obvious when they are given a small task or a practice task that is easier than what most others  are doing and they feel like they are going slow. What I’ve seen them do more than anything is put their head down, and work really intensely at their tasks.  While this sounds like a virtuous thing to do (and it is well meaning), it’s the wrong approach.  Here is some perspective that hopefully helps new Jr. devs get better results with a lot less frustration.</p>

<p>Often one of the first things a Jr. Dev does is forget to take breaks when they are stuck.  I imagine the programming headaches are very intense.  They get zoned in so solidly on the issue that they are stuck on, they can’t step back and see how it fits into the larger picture.   Somehow because they are on the job now, they don’t think stepping away is the right decision anymore.  The same tricks that worked for them when learning to code (taking a 5 minute walk) all of the sudden seems like the wrong choice.  If you don’t feel comfortable getting up and walking, open your computer screen to some unrelated documentation and zone out for 5 minutes.  Clearing your head is an important part of being able to think.</p>

<p>When two or more Jr. Devs start at the same time,  it’s pretty natural that they aren’t at the same place and their skillsets aren’t even.  If the other devs are further along than you, that’s fine.  You weren’t picked because it’s a race or to see which one of you was better.  You were picked because the hiring team saw potential.  Your job is to prove them right, not to be better or faster than the other members.  It’s hard to see, but the people that are further along have their own shortcomings and issues that they need to grow with.</p>

<p>On a related side note, don’t apologize for not knowing things.  It’s not a surprise to the team that a Jr. Dev has knowledge gaps.  The more you are worrying about looking contrite for your shortcomings, the less you can hear the ideas that people are trying to share with you.</p>

<p>The amount you have to learn as a new hire onto a dev team is staggering for anyone normally.  For Jr. Devs, it’s much worse because you don’t have all of your coding concepts fully formed.  Senior devs don’t learn it all in one pass and they understand what’s being told to them much better.  Server architecture, deployment strategy, version control practices, coding styles and practices, key terms that are unique to their projects, business goals, where to find documents, how the team handles QA, ticketing systems,... there are plenty more.  All of these are things you will eventually figure out and they will be different with every job you take.  When others tell you how some of these things work,  take notes when you can, but don’t expect it to be perfectly fit in your head.</p>

<p>Give yourself some grace.  Take some time and read part of the code base every day.  I know it doesn’t feel like it moves you towards the goal of whatever ticket you are given, but spending an hour a day figuring out the code base early on will get you up to speed more quickly.  Take the time to connect the dots of how things fit together.  Instead of a being a reliable producer in x months, maybe you will get there in x/1.5.  Take some time during your tickets to think about how whatever you’re touching fits into their codebase. Asking a question to help you understand that section of the code gives a much better feeling to your mentors than an apology.</p>

<p>Proving too much too soon really comes down to trying to prove you are valuable to the team.  Doing this causes you to make suboptimal choices.  Let go of the imposter syndrome and do your best to grow.  This might seem crazy to Jr. Developers, but people going too fast is just as scary as people going too slowly.   Someone that kicks out projects too fast looks like they aren’t thinking about the implications of their work.   If you are a new Jr. Developer, you were hired for a reason.  Prove their choice right by growing in your knowledge of the company, growing your coding knowledge,  and producing quality work.</p>
