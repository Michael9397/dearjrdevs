        <p>When I was first learning to code, I made the mistake of thinking that concepts were more important than the word choice used to describe them. It feels like a true thought right? If I understand data is changed in the database, why is the word update important? If I understand that a function doesn’t have a name, why do I need the word anonymous? If I understand that a string never really changes, why do I need the word immutable?</p>

<p>When Windows 10 first came out, I was playing with it. There was a screen before you login that had a picture I wanted to change. I don’t know why I cared, but it was worth Googling it. I googled “How to change the screen before the login in screen on Windows 10” I got nothing. I tried wording it slightly differently a few times and got nothing. I knew there were probably already 100 tutorials online for how to change the picture. Eventually I stumbled onto the Google phrase “what is the screen before the login screen called on Windows 10” and learned that like a phone, it was a lock screen. Maybe that’s common knowledge today, but for me it was a revelation. Having the precise word mattered because it’s what everyone used to know what they are discussing. I entered “how to change the windows 10 lock screen” and indeed found pages of tutorials on how to do what I wanted.</p>

<p>If someone talks to you about functional methods and you think they are talking about the word function before the method is written (or def in Python), you are going to miss the point of what they are trying to say. As you probably know, there is a philosophy called functional programming that has more depth than the syntax of a function call. I’m not here to sell you on it’s value, but I do want to understand that having the definition of things helps you understand the conversation a lot better.</p>

<p>My “secret” to doing well in my programming classes when I went back to school for a programming degree was I read the chapter before the professor talked about the subject. Instead of making the conversation boring, it meant I was able to pick up on fine details while other people were still trying to understand the basics of what he was talking about. Because I understood the terminology and basic concepts I was in a refinement process of my mental model for programming while almost everyone else was adding to theirs.</p>

<p>The world of programming revolves around terminology.  In the same way that code can’t function without the correct keywords, we have to use the keywords correctly as well to be on the right track.  I often found I got a lecture instead of helping with the answer when I asked a question using the wrong terminology. The experienced developer was more concerned with getting my mindset right than they were answering the question for me.  Early on I thought this was just rudeness on their part.  Now I understand that they can’t get me to understand the answer they would give me if the words they say mean something different to them than they do to me.  I’m still working on how to help people without being the jerk I used to think others were.</p>

<p>What a “Mental Model” really means is our picture of how things work. We all have faulty assumptions for how things work. The closer to the right our understanding gets, the better choices we make with our code. This letter was about being able to find answers through using correct terminology, but there will be more. The first step to being able to make solid choices with your code is being able to attach the concepts to the right words. It saves mapping them and changing them later on. It also makes it easier to ask Google and other coders. The biggest gain might be hearing less lectures about terminology when you are trying to get your questions about concepts and coding problems answered. That used to drive me crazy!</p>
